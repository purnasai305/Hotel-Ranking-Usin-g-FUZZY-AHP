                    The project aims to address the challenge faced by travelers in selecting a suitable hotel based on their preferences. It recognizes the importance of factors such as budget, hospitality, health, hotel location, amenities, testimonials, booking system, fun things to do, meals, branding, preferences, service, safety and security, hidden fees, and other benefits in the hotel selection process.

The methodology involves fuzzification, which converts crisp input values into fuzzy values using membership functions. Pair-wise comparison tables are created to determine the relative importance of criteria, and fuzzy numbers are used to represent these values. Fuzzy geometric mean and fuzzy weights are calculated to determine the overall ranking of hotels. De-fuzzification is performed using the Centre of Area (COA) method to obtain crisp numeric values.

The project report includes a list of tables, figures, and equations related to the fuzzy AHP methodology. It also provides an introduction, methodology, discussion, concluding remarks, and future work sections.
